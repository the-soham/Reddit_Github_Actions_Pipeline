# Interactions of Football/Soccer Club Fans on Reddit

## Description

In this project, I have tried to capture the interactions of football fans of all the 20 Football clubs of the English Premier Club. The data is scraped at a 24 hr interval using reddit's PRAW api and jupyter notebook that is orchestrated using Github Actions. The scraped data is then stored in Data Folder as a csv file. The fan interactions are then displayed on a public facing [dashboard](https://reddit-epl-interactions.streamlit.app/) created using streamlit.
